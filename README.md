My Course Assignments for Intro to Microprocessor Systems at Florida Atlantic University

16-bit microprocessor used: Texas Instrument's MSP4300G2553


Lab 1: Write an assembly program that adds the content of Registers R4, R5, and R6 to register R7 then subtract the content of R10 from R7.  Once calculation is done all values of above mentioned registers must be saved in memory starting at memory address 0x0200.  Use these register values: R4 = 14, R5 = 15, R6 = 16, R10 = 10


Lab 2: The program of this exercise deals with arrays of numbers and subroutines.  As a reference, next page is the program outlines. At the beginning of your program you will allocate empty storage for two original arrays and their sorted versions
